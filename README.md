## GTK theme made for KDE to match the Materia KDE light theme.It just works and looks better to me than the normal gtk version because it is built for GTK in KDE. The colors are all the same but it was built for KDE in KDE so it works great.You can use your stock title bars and even Breeze title bars in the Browser and other places and it still looks great. There is differences in normal GTK and KDE gtk and for these differences is why this works btter TO ME.


## If your using the regular Materia KDE light theme then I would give this a shot.
